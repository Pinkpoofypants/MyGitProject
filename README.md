Assignment 2 for computer concepts COMP1243
1. Names entered in a shared spreadsheet
Aaleyah Evans - (Leyah242) - 100159912
Charlie Allaby (Pinkpoofypants) - 100161606

2. Problem:
Develop a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where a user plays against the computer in a command-line interface (CLI). The game should:  
- Allow the user to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors."  
- Randomly generate the computerâ€™s choice.  
- Compare choices and determine the winner based on standard rules:  
  - Rock beats Scissors  
  - Scissors beats Paper  
  - Paper beats Rock  
  - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.  
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.  

The project should also demonstrate **collaborative coding** using GitHub, including **branching, pull requests, and commits** to manage contributions from multiple team members.

5. Coding Tasks:
Aaleyah: Focused on creating the driver class. This allowed us to print out the instructions for the user to see and then use the user input to let the user choose rock, paper, or scissors. Lastly, an if statement was created to validate the user input.

2. Problem:
Develop a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where a user plays against the computer in a command-line interface (CLI). The game should:  
- Allow the user to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors."  
- Randomly generate the computer’s choice.  
- Compare choices and determine the winner based on standard rules:  
  - Rock beats Scissors  
  - Scissors beats Paper  
  - Paper beats Rock  
  - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.  
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.  

The project should also demonstrate **collaborative coding** using GitHub, including **branching, pull requests, and commits** to manage contributions from multiple team members.

5. Coding Tasks:
Aaleyah: Focused on creating the driver class. This allowed us to print out the instructions for the user to see and then use the user input to let the user choose rock, paper, or scissors. Lastly, an if statement was created to validate the user input.

7. Version Control Workflow:

To effectively collaborate on this project, we established a structured version control workflow using GitHub. Our repository contained two main branches:  

1. **`mygithubproject.1` Branch** – This branch focused on implementing the core functionality of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It contained the logic for user input, computer-generated choices, and determining the winner.  

2. **`frontend` Branch** – This branch served as the driver class, handling user interaction and executing the game based on the logic implemented in the first branch.  

Each team member worked on their assigned task within their respective branches, making commits as they progressed. Once the changes were tested and verified, we merged the `frontend` branch with `mygithubproject.1`, ensuring a seamless integration of functionality and user interaction. This workflow allowed us to maintain an organized structure while efficiently tracking and managing contributions.

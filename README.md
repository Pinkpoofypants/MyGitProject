2. Problem:
Develop a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where a user plays against the computer in a command-line interface (CLI). The game should:  
- Allow the user to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors."  
- Randomly generate the computerâ€™s choice.  
- Compare choices and determine the winner based on standard rules:  
  - Rock beats Scissors  
  - Scissors beats Paper  
  - Paper beats Rock  
  - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.  
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.  

The project should also demonstrate **collaborative coding** using GitHub, including **branching, pull requests, and commits** to manage contributions from multiple team members.
